  # Is It Cold In Here?
  ## An Exploration of Gender, Comic Books, and a Beloved Kitchen Appliance

### _About_

[FiveThirtyEight] (fivethirtyeight.com) is a website that dedicates itself to increasing public knowledge through the use of data visualization. On October 13, 2014, an article was published called [Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men] (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/). The goal of the article was to use data on comic book characters from both the Marvel and DC Comics collections to come to look at comic book characters and their historical development through the lens of gender. Ironically, the article was written by a man--Walt Hickey. 

Hickey made the data public on Github, allowing me to use it for my Digital Humanities Project. There are two datasets (one for Marvel and one for DC) that pulls its data from the respective Wikia blog pages of every recorded character in the compendium.
