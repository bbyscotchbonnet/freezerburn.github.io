# Who's Hungry?
#### _Or, A Brief Acknoweledgment On Behalf of *Fictional* Women Everywhere_

One of the great tragedies of sentience is the inability to turn your brain off. You are constantly observing, analyzing, and coming to conclusions. Just because the things that you are observing aren't necessarily grounded in reality does not mean that they exist outside of that process. Fiction--especially speculative fiction, whose historical evolution is oriented around its _rejection_ of reality in favor of imagining impossibility--is not above analysis and critique [1]. In other words, despite how much I love comic books, it does not mean that a switch in my brain labeled **feminism** gets flipped off so I can enjoy the plot.  

In 1999, comic book writer Gail Simone published a website called [Women In Refrigerators](https://lby3.com/wir/index.html). Simone, not a comic book expert by any means, had realized that there was a trend when it came to female characters in comic books. Publishing an inexhuastive list of characters, she presented her general conclusions to the public for their opinion. "...It occurred to me that it's not that healthy to be a female character in comics." Because of this publication, Women Refrigerators (also known as 'fridging' or 'being fridged') has become a critical term in the pop culture glossary.

"These are superheroines who have been either depowered, raped, or cut up and stuck in the refrigerator.
I know I missed a bunch. Some have been revived, even improved -- although the question remains as to why
they were thrown in the wood chipper in the first place."
                                                                        -Gail Simone, March 1999

I am undergoing this project because I have a deep and unabiding love for comic books and speculative fiction. The real world can range from boring to downright emotionally exhausting, and the imaginaries of speculative fiction provide a comfort to many of the people who like to read it. But that comfort is not above critique, and in knowing that modern comic books--written exclusively by men--emerged in the early 1900s and it's "Golden" and "Silver" ages existed while women still campaigned for gender equality despite the 19th Amendment's (women's suffrage) passage in 1920 makes me wonder as much as Gail how much progress has really been made when it comes to female (or nin-binary) representation in the genre. This project aims to identify any disaparities between male, female, and non-binary characters according to the available data. While limited in my ability to provide context to the characters (which would be extremely helpful in determining whether a female character was actually fridged or not), I can at least seek to draw initial conclusions about gender representation in comic books over time (up to 2014).

(This project is also due during Women's History Month, and not analysing this data along the lines of gender feels **very, very wrong**.)

#### _Or, insight into the data_

Published on Github, this project will take advantage of both the Marvel Comics and DC Comics datasets provided by Walt Hickey of [FiveThirtyEight] (https://fivethirtyeight.com/). Both datasets mine the information on their respective comic book universes through their Wikia databases. The datasets provided records thousands of comic book characters in their mainstream plot universes (10,000 for Marvel and 6,897 for DC) and information on their name, identity status (secret or public), moral alignment, eye color, hair color, gender, sexual orientation (when available), whether the character is alive or not, their total number of appearances, their first appearance in an issue (month , year), and their year of appearance. The datasets were compiled and published in 2014, and are therefore outdated in several ways--primarily along the categories of number of characters, number of appearances, and potentially whether the characters are alive or not.

Though the data itself was already cleaned by Walt Hickey of FiveThirtyEight for the purposes of his article, I ran the data through OpenRefine just in case any of it needed to be scaled or cleaned. *note: it didn't.* All visualizations were completed using Tabeau Public.
